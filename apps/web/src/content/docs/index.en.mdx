# Distill Documentation

Distill is an open source MCP server that helps you optimize LLM token usage. It provides intelligent context compression, smart file reading, and analysis tools for Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.

**No authentication, no API keys, no cloud services** - just install and use.

> **What is MCP?**
> MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that allows AI assistants (Claude Code, Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf) to communicate with external servers. Distill is an MCP server that helps your AI consume fewer "tokens" (billed text units) by intelligently compressing the information it processes.

## Quick Start

Get started with Distill in 3 simple steps:

### 1. Install the MCP Server

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g distill-mcp

# Or run directly with npx
npx distill-mcp
```

### 2. Configure your IDE

Add the MCP server to your IDE configuration. For Claude Code, edit `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "distill": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["distill-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Start saving tokens

The MCP server provides 21 optimization tools. Use `session_stats` to see your savings in real-time.

## Features

- **21 Optimization Tools** - Smart file reading, build output compression, log summarization, and more
- **AST-Aware Parsing** - Extract functions, classes, and types from code (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, PHP, Swift)
- **Universal IDE Support** - Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client
- **50-95% Token Savings** - Depending on content type
