# Cursor Integration

This guide walks you through setting up Distill with Cursor IDE.

## Prerequisites

- Cursor installed ([download](https://cursor.com))
- Node.js 18+ installed

## Quick Setup (30 seconds)

```bash
npm install -g distill-mcp
distill-mcp setup --cursor
```

Done! Restart Cursor and you're ready.

## Manual Setup

If the automatic setup didn't work:

**Via UI:** File → Preferences → Cursor Settings → MCP → Add Custom MCP

**Via file:** Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (per-project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "distill": {
      "command": "distill-mcp",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or with npx (no global install):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "distill": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["distill-mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Verify Installation

Restart Cursor, then ask in the AI chat:

```
What MCP tools are available?
```

You should see the Distill tools listed.

## Using Distill with Cursor

### Code Navigation

Use smart file reading for exploring code:

```
Use smart_file_read to show the structure of src/api/routes.ts
```

### Build Error Analysis

When builds fail:

```
Analyze this build output with auto_optimize: [paste errors]
```

### Diff Compression

For large diffs:

```
Compress this git diff: [paste diff]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use smart_file_read** for code exploration instead of opening files directly
2. **Compress build output** before pasting into chat
3. **Check session_stats** periodically to see your savings

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Found

1. Verify installation: `npx distill-mcp --version`
2. Check Cursor's MCP logs in the Output panel
3. Try running the server manually to check for errors

### Tools Not Working

1. Restart Cursor completely
2. Check that the JSON config is valid in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
3. Ensure Node.js 18+ is in your PATH
4. Check logs in the Output panel (View → Output → MCP)
